# Flappy Bird Clone

This project is a clone of the popular Flappy Bird game, developed using Unity. The game involves controlling a bird, navigating it through pipes by tapping the screen to make the bird "flap" and avoid obstacles.

## Features

* **Simple Controls**: Tap to make the bird flap its wings.
* **Scoring System**: Keep track of your score as you pass through pipes.
* **Random Pipe Generation**: Pipes are generated at random intervals and heights to keep the game challenging.
* **Game Over Screen**: Displays the final score and gives an option to restart the game.
